Exxica Inbound Marketing is a plugin to automatically create inbound marketing links based on your input.

== Description ==
This is a small plugin made to ease the process of adding automated inbound links to all content throughout a WordPress site. You will be able to, on each post and page, create inbound links for this article - meaning that you will be able to send your readers back to your own site with the links, thus keeping them on your site longer.

It's a very light-weight plugin - with no tethers to other sites and no loading of additional CSS.

You are technically able to create multiple inbound links to articles with the same sentence or keyword, but a unique composition is recommended. If you are to use a non-unique composition, the plugin will not be able to see which to use and the result may be inadequate.

== Installation ==
= Automatic installation =
1. Press **Install** to install this plugin to your WordPress.
2. Enable the plugin in WP admin.

= Manual installation =
1. Download `exxica-inbound-marketing.zip` from any available source.
2. Connect to your FTP server and upload and extract the zip-archive to your `/wp-content/plugins/` folder.
3. Enable the plugin in WP admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= How do I separate each word or sentence from eachother in the article's inbound link box? =
You can separate each word or sentence by using semicolon or ";".

= Can I use non-unique words or sentences to link to different parts of the site? =
Technically you can, but we have not made any interface to determine which to use - so you will most likely have a site that becomes somewhat chaotic to use because of this. It's recommended that you use unique words or sentences to link to each and every site you need links to.

== Screenshots ==
1. A page with the links generated by the plugin. Note that all the links added by the plugin will use the class "exxica-inbound-link" so that you can easily style it with any custom CSS.
